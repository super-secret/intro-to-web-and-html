## The purpose of this class

We'll be going over how the web works, and then, more interestingly, how to make a website using HTML and CSS.

##### Have you used a website-builder like Squarespace or Wix or Wordpress or Drupal before?
##### Why are we going into HTML and CSS and code in general, when there are services that make websites for you without you having to touch a line of code?

The analogy I like to use to explain this is Microsoft Word. Out-of-the-box, you can use Word to make a document that looks 75% like what you had in mind. In order to make it 100% like what you had in mind, you either need to know Word *extremely* well, or you just need to use another program.

##### Have you ever had the experience of spending 3 hours on a Word document just trying to get your stupid image to align the right way?

Content Management Systems, aka CMS-es, aka or website-builders, will quickly give you a website that looks pretty OK. If "pretty OK" is all you want, and your intent is just to get a web store online as quickly as possible, then a CMS is the way to go.

If, however, you want to have a site that's 100% the way you want it, and to have complete control over your appearance and product, then you need to pop the hood and use code.
